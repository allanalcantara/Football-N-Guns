## ☉ Description

Football N' Guns is a mini-mod for Half-Life 1 based on map ukfootie from Mr.Bee. It's very fun and easy to play.

Gamemode is very similar to football (soccer), but with guns. Some hints:

- To score take the ball to the enemy's goal. Watch out you don't score an own goal!
- There are four classes: Scout, Medic, Soldier and Goalkeeper. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages. 
- Goalies have invulnerability and quad damage but can not leave the goal area.
